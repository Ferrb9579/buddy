# Notification Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified

The app was not sending notifications at scheduled times due to several critical configuration issues:

1. **Missing Android Manifest Receivers**: The `flutter_local_notifications` plugin requires specific broadcast receivers to handle scheduled notifications and device reboots.

2. **Missing Exact Alarm Permissions**: Android 12+ requires explicit permissions (`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` and `USE_EXACT_ALARM`) to schedule notifications at exact times.

3. **Missing Boot Receiver Permission**: Without `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission, notifications won't be rescheduled after device reboot.

4. **No Notification Response Handlers**: The plugin wasn't configured with callbacks to handle notification taps, which could cause silent failures.

5. **Missing MultiDex Support**: Required for apps with large dependency sets.

6. **Missing WindowManager Dependencies**: Prevents potential crashes on Android 12L+ when desugaring is enabled.

## Changes Made

### 1. AndroidManifest.xml (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)

**Added Permissions:**
```xml
<!-- Exact alarm permissions for scheduled notifications (Android 12+) -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM" />
<!-- Boot completed permission to reschedule notifications after device reboot -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

**Added Broadcast Receivers:**
```xml
<!-- Receivers for flutter_local_notifications scheduled notifications -->
<receiver android:exported="false" android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ScheduledNotificationReceiver" />
<receiver android:exported="false" android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ScheduledNotificationBootReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED"/>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.QUICKBOOT_POWERON" />
        <action android:name="com.htc.intent.action.QUICKBOOT_POWERON"/>
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
<receiver android:exported="false" android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ActionBroadcastReceiver" />
```

### 2. ReminderService (`lib/services/reminder_service.dart`)

**Added Notification Response Handlers:**
- Configured `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback for foreground notification taps
- Configured `onDidReceiveBackgroundNotificationResponse` callback for background notification taps
- Added proper logging for debugging notification interactions

```dart
// Initialize with notification response callback
await _plugin.initialize(
  initializationSettings,
  onDidReceiveNotificationResponse: _onNotificationResponse,
  onDidReceiveBackgroundNotificationResponse: _onBackgroundNotificationResponse,
);
```

### 3. build.gradle.kts (`android/app/build.gradle.kts`)

**Added MultiDex Support:**
```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    // ... existing config
    multiDexEnabled = true
}
```

**Added WindowManager Dependencies:**
```kotlin
dependencies {
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.4")
    // WindowManager to prevent crashes on Android 12L+ with desugaring
    implementation("androidx.window:window:1.0.0")
    implementation("androidx.window:window-java:1.0.0")
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clean and rebuild the app:**
   ```powershell
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   flutter build apk
   ```

2. **Install and test:**
   - Install the rebuilt app on your Android device
   - Go to Reminders & Notifications page
   - Tap "Send test reminder now" to verify immediate notifications work
   - Schedule a reminder for 1-2 minutes in the future
   - Lock your device and wait for the notification
   - Verify the notification appears at the scheduled time

3. **Test after reboot (optional):**
   - Schedule a reminder for several minutes in the future
   - Reboot your device
   - Wait for the scheduled time
   - Verify the notification still appears (tests boot receiver)

## Android Settings to Check

1. **Notification Permission**: Settings → Apps → Buddy → Notifications (must be enabled)
2. **Alarms & Reminders Permission**: Settings → Apps → Buddy → Alarms & reminders (must be allowed for Android 13+)
3. **Battery Optimization**: Settings → Apps → Buddy → Battery → Not optimized (recommended for reliable notifications)

## Debugging

If notifications still don't work:

1. Check logcat for errors:
   ```powershell
   adb logcat | Select-String "ReminderService|flutter_local_notifications"
   ```

2. Verify pending notifications:
   - The app's UI shows scheduled reminders on the Reminders page
   - If reminders show in the list but don't trigger, check device battery optimization settings

3. Check notification channel settings:
   - Long-press on a notification when it appears
   - Verify "Buddy Reminders" channel is not silenced or minimized
