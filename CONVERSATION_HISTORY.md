# Conversation History Feature Implementation

## ‚úÖ What's been implemented:

### 1. **Conversation History Storage**
- **Location**: `lib/services/conversation_history_service.dart`
- **Storage**: Uses `shared_preferences` for persistent local storage
- **Capacity**: Keeps last 20 messages to prevent unlimited growth
- **Format**: JSON serialization with timestamps

### 2. **User Information Extraction**
- **Smart Name Detection**: Automatically extracts user's name from phrases like:
  - "Hi, I am Anto"
  - "My name is Anto"
  - "Call me Anto"
  - "I'm Anto"
- **Context Building**: Creates user profile for personalized responses

### 3. **Enhanced AI Responses**
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI receives conversation history and user info
- **Personalized Responses**: AI can use user's name and reference previous conversations
- **Memory Continuity**: AI remembers what was discussed before

### 4. **Updated Services**

#### OpenRouter Service (`lib/services/openrouter_service.dart`)
```dart
Future<String> generateResponse(
  String userMessage, {
  List<ConversationMessage>? conversationHistory,
  Map<String, String>? userInfo
})
```

#### Buddy Controller (`lib/controllers/Buddy.controller.dart`)
- Saves user messages and AI responses to history
- Loads recent context (last 8 messages) for AI
- Extracts user information for personalization
- New `clearHistory()` method

### 5. **UI Enhancements**
- **Clear History Button**: New button to reset conversation memory
- **Better Layout**: Three-button layout (Clear, Stop, Microphone)

## üéØ Example Usage Scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Name Learning
```
User: "Hi, I am Anto"
Buddy: "Hi Anto! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"

User: "Generate an email"
Buddy: "I'd be happy to help you write an email, Anto. What's the email about?"
```

### Scenario 2: Context Awareness
```
User: "I need help with my project"
Buddy: "I'd be happy to help! What kind of project are you working on?"

User: "It's about machine learning"
Buddy: "Great! What specific aspect of your machine learning project do you need help with?"

User: "Can you write an email to my professor about it?"
Buddy: "Sure! I can help you write an email to your professor about your machine learning project. What would you like to say?"
```

## üîß Key Features:

1. **Persistent Memory**: Conversations survive app restarts
2. **Context Window**: Uses last 8 messages for AI context
3. **User Profiling**: Automatically builds user profile
4. **Smart Cleanup**: Auto-manages storage size
5. **Easy Reset**: Clear history button for fresh starts

## üì± How to Use:

1. **Start Talking**: Say "Hi, I am [Your Name]"
2. **Continue Conversations**: Ask follow-up questions that reference previous context
3. **Generate Content**: Ask Buddy to write emails, and it will use your name and conversation context
4. **Clear Memory**: Use the "Clear" button to reset conversation history

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation:

- **Models**: `ConversationMessage` with role, content, timestamp
- **Storage**: SharedPreferences for cross-session persistence
- **Context Management**: Smart message limiting and user info extraction
- **API Integration**: Enhanced OpenRouter calls with full conversation context

The conversation history is now fully functional and will remember your name and previous conversations to provide more personalized and contextually aware responses!
